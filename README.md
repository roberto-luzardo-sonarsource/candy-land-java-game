## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with automated testing and code quality analysis.

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push to main branch**: Full build, test, and SonarQube analysis
- **Pull requests**: Build, test, and analysis for code review

### Pipeline Features
- **Automated Testing**: Runs complete test suite on every commit
- **Code Coverage**: Generates coverage reports with JaCoCo
- **SonarQube Analysis**: Static code analysis for quality, security, and maintainability
- **Dependency Caching**: Optimized build times with Maven and SonarQube caching
- **Artifact Upload**: Test results and analysis artifacts for review

### Setting Up SonarQube Integration

To enable SonarQube analysis in your fork:

1. **Set up SonarQube Server** - Ensure you have access to a SonarQube Server instance
2. **Create a Project** in SonarQube Server with key `candy-land-java-game`
3. **Generate Authentication Token** in SonarQube Server
4. **Add repository secrets** in GitHub Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:
   - `SONAR_TOKEN`: Your SonarQube Server authentication token
   - `SONAR_HOST_URL`: Your SonarQube Server URL (e.g., `https://your-sonarqube-server.com`)

#### Getting Your SonarQube Server Token
1. Log in to your SonarQube Server
2. Go to **My Account** > **Security** 
3. Generate a new token with appropriate permissions
4. Copy the token and add as `SONAR_TOKEN` in GitHub repository secrets

#### Project Setup in SonarQube Server
1. Create a new project in SonarQube Server
2. Use project key: `candy-land-java-game`
3. Configure quality gates and analysis settings as needed

### Quality Gates
The SonarQube analysis checks for:
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities and security hotspots
- **Maintainability**: Code smells and technical debt
- **Reliability**: Bugs and potential runtime issues

## Building and Running

### Using Maven Commands

1. **Compile the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

3. **Run the GUI game (local mode):**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

4. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

### Online Multiplayer Mode

#### Starting the Game Server

To host an online multiplayer game, first start the server:

```bash
# Using Maven (default port 8888)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.candyland.network.server.CandyLandServer"

# Or specify a custom port
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.candyland.network.server.CandyLandServer" -Dexec.args="9999"

# Or compile and run directly
mvn compile
java -cp target/classes com.example.candyland.network.server.CandyLandServer 8888
```

The server will start and listen for client connections. It supports:
- Multiple game rooms (players specify a room ID when joining)
- Up to 3 players per game room
- Automatic game state synchronization
- Connection management and error handling

#### Joining an Online Game

1. Run the game client:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

2. Select "Join Online Game" from the welcome dialog

3. Enter connection details:
   - **Server Host**: IP address or hostname (use `localhost` for local testing)
   - **Server Port**: Port number (default: 8888)
   - **Your Name**: Your player name
   - **Room ID**: Game room identifier (use the same ID to play with friends)

4. Click "Connect" and wait for other players to join

5. Game starts automatically when 2+ players have joined

#### Network Architecture

The multiplayer system uses a client-server architecture:

- **Server (`CandyLandServer`)**: Manages game rooms, player connections, and game state
- **Client (`GameClient`)**: Connects to server and handles network communication
- **Messages**: Serialized Java objects for game events and state updates
- **Protocol**: TCP/IP sockets with ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream

Game rooms are isolated - each room ID represents a separate game instance.

### Using VS Code Tasks

This project includes predefined VS Code tasks that you can run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Build Candy Land Game** - Compile the project
- **Run Candy Land Game** - Start the GUI game
- **Test Candy Land Game** - Run unit tests
- **Clean and Build** - Clean and recompile

### Using VS Code Debug Configuration

A debug configuration is available for running the game in debug mode:

- **Debug Candy Land Game** - Launch with debugger attached
